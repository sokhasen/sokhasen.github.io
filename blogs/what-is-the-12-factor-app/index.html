                    <h2>What is The 12 Factor App?</h2>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The twelve-factor app is a methodology used to build software-as-a-service apps. It serves as a best
                    practice guide to create apps with low time and cost for new developers joining a project and to
                    make
                    them scale up without significant changes to tooling or architecture.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language. These are
                    the
                    12 factors to consider:
                </p>

                    <li>12. Admin Processes</li>
                </ol>

                <!-- content -->
                <h2>1 - Codebase</h2>
                <p>The codebase terms refer to the version control system used to keep track of any changes to the
                    application. Git or Subversion are common version control tools. In 12-factor apps, there should be
                    a one to one correlation between the codebase and the app.<br><br>If there are multiple codebases,
                    then there is not a single application but a distributed system. In that scenario, each codebase is
                    treated as an independent component and they should comply with 12-factor app.<br><br>It is
                    considered a violation for multiple applications to share a single codebase. To avoid that, we can
                    externalise shared code into dependency libraries.<br><br>The deployment of an application is going
                    target its particular codebase.</p>
                <h2>2 - Dependencies</h2>
                <p>Software dependencies are pieces of code that can be reused on multiple apps by publishing them as
                    packages or libraries. In 12-Factor apps, all dependencies must be declared into a manifest and
                    installed using a package manager.<br><br>An application must not rely on implicit existence of
                    system packages but, instead, use the package manager to reference them. That prevents cross device
                    issues, 'It works on my machine' error, and also ensures the app has all dependencies it needs to
                    run on every type of system.<br><br>In addition to that, 12-Factor apps also use a dependency
                    isolation tool during execution to ensure that no implicit dependencies 'leak in' from the
                    surrounding system. For front-end web applications that can be achieved using a Docker container.
                </p>
                <h2>3 - Configurations</h2>
                <p>The app configs are values that are susceptible to change between environment and stages. We must
                    separate those values from the code logic as the codebase does not change between
                    deployments.<br><br>A config file is intended to store values such as: Connection strings to
                    databases, credentials for external services like third party APIs or environment related settings
                    such as the hostname of the application.<br><br>An application must never store those types of
                    values in their code and worst add them to its version control. That is a violation of the 12-Factor
                    app methodology. All apps following 12-factor should store the config values on environment
                    variables and be language-agnostic.<br><br>The group of configs is also important. It is not
                    recommended to group config variables as environment names <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code>,
                    <code>staging</code> and <code>prod</code> as this approach does not escalate smoothly. In a
                    twelve-factor apps, config are like granular controls been fully orthogonal to other
                    <code>env</code> vars. The grouping should represent their independent use.</p>
                <h2>4 - Backing Services </h2>
                <p>Applications usually rely on external service in order to perform their actions. Examples of backing
                    services are databases, caches or queues. <br><br>12-Factor apps tread all service as attached
                    resources and do not make a distinction between local and third party services. For an application,
                    all attached resources are going to be accessed via the details stored in the config.
                    <br><br>Because backing services vary between deployments, there shouldn’t be hardcoded settings of
                    external services on the application’s code.</p>
                <h2>5 - Build, release and run</h2>
                <p>There are usually three stages to convert a codebase intro a releasable build:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Build stage is the process of compiling the source code into an executable bundle or build
                        files. In this process third party libraries, assets and vendor dependencies are compiled
                        together.</li>
                    <li>Release stage, where the bundle and the config files are combined resulting in a release which
                        is ready for runtime execution.</li>
                    <li>Run stage is the execution environment where the application is going to run.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>12-Factor applications are based on a strict separation between stages, preventing any kind of
                    changes into a released bundle. This approach enforces that new changes after the compilation
                    require a new release. </p>
                <h2>6 - Processes</h2>
                <p>Apps are treated as independent running processes. The crash of an application should not take down
                    other services. <br><br>All data used by the application must be stored on backing services such as
                    databases. Each process on a 12-factor app is stateless and shares nothing. While many developers
                    are used to 'sticky sessions', storing information in the session expecting the next request will be
                    from the same service contradicts this methodology.</p>
                <h2>7 - Port Binding</h2>
                <p>Unlike some web apps that are executed inside a webserver container, a Twelve-Factor acts as a
                    standalone service. It must be a self-contained application which means it doesn’t rely on any
                    existing/running application server to get executed.<br><br>In a traditional setup, applications
                    assume web protocols such as HTTP, are always available on the environment they are deployed to.
                    <br><br>In 12-factor methodology, applications are completely self-contained. They are required to
                    add a web server library or similar to the core app in order to listed for requests on a defined
                    port, whether requests are stablished via HTTP or a different protocol.</p>
                <h2>8 - Concurrency</h2>
                <p>Can be seen as a way towards the micro services architecture. The idea is to be able to scale up and
                    out, meaning that the application should be able to rely on workers and delegate certain
                    functionality to other apps.<br><br>For example, HTTP requests may be handled by a web process and
                    long-running background tasks handled by a worker process. <br><br>The concept behind concurrency is
                    to optimise CPU resources by running multiple processes on parallel threads. The 12-Factor
                    methodology do not exclude multiplexing on individual processed (scale up) but dictates that
                    applications must be able to span multiple processes running on multiple physical machines (scale
                    out).</p>
                <h2>9 - Disposability</h2>
                <p>Applications that are disposable mean they can be started or stopped rapidly. An application cannot
                    scale or recover rapidly if it cannot start rapidly and shut down gracefully.<br><br>12 factor apps
                    should be quick to start up. Ideally they should start in less than 1 minute.<br><br>Application are
                    graceful to shut down when they receive a terminal signal and within 10 seconds are able to release
                    resources and clean up any connections.<br><br>When both of this principles apply to an app, we can
                    consider this application to be resilience to failure.</p>
                <h2>10 - Environment parity</h2>
                <p>This principle states that environments where the app is deployed need to be identical or with only
                    minor difference between them.<br><br>The most common place when this principle gets violated is at
                    the database or container layer. If production environment is, for example, using PostgreSQL the
                    development environment needs to also use that same manager.<br><br>Twelve-factor applications are
                    designed for Continuous Deployment reducing the gap between environments where the application is
                    deployed to. This principle allows to reduce time solving cross-environment issues and ensuring the
                    app’s behaviour is the same on each deployment. <br><br>When the parity principle is used correctly,
                    it can lead to other beneficial principles like reproducibility (scale up) or disposability (can
                    easily be recreated). </p>
                <h2>11 - Logs</h2>
                <p>The behaviour of a running application can be reviewed thanks to its logs. Logs, which are usually
                    stored as system files, record events that occurred while an application is running.<br><br>In
                    12-Factor methodology, applications do not handle the routing or storage of its output log streams.
                    Instead, they write their streams into the standard output <code>stdout</code> that is the default
                    file descriptor where a process can write output.</p>
                <h2>12 - Admin processes</h2>
                <p>Administrative or maintenance tasks such as background one-off jobs or database migrations should be
                    run as isolated processes.<br><br>Essentially we should not log into a production server which is
                    handling requests and try to run a one-off job directly. The outcome of doing this may vary from
                    using production resources from the main app to even crashing the production system.<br><br>The
                    12-Factor methodology states that these types of jobs need to be run as an isolated process which
                    can be run in the same environment as the production application without affecting the main
                    application.</p>
